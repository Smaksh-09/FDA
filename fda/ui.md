How to Use This in a Master Prompt
Here is how you would combine these keywords into a powerful prompt for Cursor to generate the main Reels page.

Example Master Prompt:

"Act as an expert UI/UX designer specializing in skeuomorphic and metaphorical interfaces. Create the frontend for the Reels Feed Page for my food delivery app using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

The core design theme is the 'Bento Box metaphor'. The entire UI should feel like a modern, digital bento box. It must feel organized, clean, and tactile.

Incorporate these specific visual elements and keywords:

Layout: Use a compartmentalized layout with CSS grid. The main video reel should be in the largest compartment.

Background & Texture: Use a subtle, dark wood grain texture for the main app background.

Colors: Use charcoal gray for UI panels and a single, powerful deep red (#B71C1C) as the accent color for buttons and highlights. Use off-white for text.

Feel & Depth: Give UI elements a lacquer finish feel with a satin sheen (you can achieve this with subtle gradients). Use inset box-shadows to make compartments feel like they are carved into the wood.

Interactions: Buttons should look and feel like latches or polished stones. Any click should have a satisfying, subtle animation.

The page should display a full-screen video reel. The overlay containing the restaurant's name and the 'Buy Now' button should look like a separate, smaller compartment within the main view."

By giving Cursor this level of specific, creative direction, you are guiding it to produce a UI that is deeply thematic and far from a generic, AI-generated design.
